# data-structures
Sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python



## Queue
A container to hold nodes in a first in first out order.

## Doubly Linked List
A container of nodes that maintain links to a previous and a next node.
A doubly linked list is better to use in situations where you would want to traverse a list backwards.

### Implemented:
* insert(val) will insert the value 'val' at the head of the list
* append(val) will append the value 'val' at the tail of the list
* pop() will pop the first value off the head of the list and return it.
* shift() will remove the last value from the tail of the list and return it.
* remove(val) will remove the first instance of 'val' found in the list, starting from the head. If 'val' is not present, it will raise an appropriate Python exception.
