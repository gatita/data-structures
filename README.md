# data-structures
Sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python

### Proper Parenthetics

* Return 1 if the string is "open" (there are open parens that are not closed)
* Return 0 if the string is "balanced" (there are an equal number of open and closed parentheses in the string)
* Return -1 if the string is "broken" (a closing parens has not been proceeded by one that opens) 

For the purposes of this assignment, open and closed parens must match.

##### Resources and Collaborators

* Discussed problem with Andrew prior to implementation
* Used assumptions from InteractivePython.org to choose data structure
